4/3
-------------------
Four things we are after:
	 - food sources
	 - enemies
	 - hills
	 - extending the boundary
	
Strategies:
	- Expand as much as possible
		- "Breadcrumb"/risk ants
		- scout? to make sure there aren't too many enemies
	- Defense strategy?
		- Keep some minimum number of ants around the hill
	- Offensive strategy, mostly
		- Collect food when convenient and needed
		- Take over hills
