4/17 (wow that was a long gap...)
--------------------
PROGRESS: Version 1.suck DONE!
State of the bot right now:
	- Food: assign each food location to nearest ant/greedy/non-optimal
	- Razing hills: if a hill is seen, 6(?) closest ants within 30 blocks are sent towards it
	- Exploring: random movement/breadcrumb [steve will fill this in, don't know what it means]
	- Defense against other ants: nothing - just surrender/die!

	- Accomplishments: wooo doesn't timeout! Except that it does.
	- Problems: Timeouts/python sucks
	
ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE: Things we suck at/need to improve
	- Lazy ants - lots of standing around -- tell them to exploooore!
	- Lots of ants dying b/c of single file -- need some collaboration
		- General Clustering
		- Buddy system while exploring? 
		- Collaboration/meet up before attacking hills
	- Food along the way is still ignored?
	- IDEA: use squads! defenders of our hill, explorers/hunter/gatherers, hill attackers

Possible motif for presentation: pop songs

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Variables:
	- Map types & terrains
	- Game parameters [food drop rate, # turns, # starting hills, # opponents]
	- Opponents (sample vs submission bots)
	- One on one vs. free for all

Metrics:
	- Points at end of game
	- Quickness of winning

Experiment 1: Testing against a variety of bots
Run each experiment one-on-one. Control all game parameters and terrain *** NEED TO CHOOSE MAP? CELL_MAZE_P02_18? ***, and keep other parameters the same as in play_one_game.sh
Independent Variable: opponents
	1) xarthis
	2) HunterBot
	3)
	4)
	5)

Experiment 2: Testing on variety of terrains
Run each experiment one-on-one. Control all parameters. *** NEED TO CHOOSE OPPONENT ***. All other parameters are from play_one_game.sh ?
Independent variable: maps - pick one from each category
	1) Random Walk
	2) Cell Maze
	3) Maze

*******NEXT STEPS:*********
	- SANA: 1) make sure food along the way is collected (or do we not care?). Optimize so that A* paths are calculated (so we don't calculate the same path repeatedly). 2) Create scripts for experiments
	- STEVE: Exploring doing something not stupid
	- SCOTT: FIGHTING!!

NEXT MEETINGS: 
	- Thu 4/19 @ 2pm - Experiment Meeting #1
	- Sat 4/21 @ 2pm - Experiment Meeting #2
	- Tue 4//24 @ 2:30pm - Experiment Meeting #3
	- Thu 4/26 @ 2pm - Last Experiment Meeting #4 / Start write up for paper!
	- Sat 4/28 @ TBD - LAST MEETING EVER (not really), finish & submit write up (due 4/29)
	- Sometime before 5/2 (how about 5/1?) - Project presentation meeting
	


4/3
-------------------
Four things we are after:
	 - food sources
	 - enemies
	 - hills
	 - extending the boundary
	
Strategies:
	- Expand as much as possible
		- "Breadcrumb"/risk ants
		- scout? to make sure there aren't too many enemies
	- Defense strategy?
		- Keep some minimum number of ants around the hill
	- Offensive strategy, mostly
		- Collect food when convenient and needed
		- Take over hills
		
TO DO THIS WEEK/HAVE DONE BY NEXT MEETING:
	- SCOTT: do_move_location and do_move_direction - make them not stupid
	- STEVE: explore_nonaimlessly - prune search space of unseen blocks
	- SANA: assign_hill_attack_missions (optimize), assign_food_missions (optimize), distance() (make more accurate than manhattan)
